### Installation

Macbook Air HighSierra 10.13.6
Python 3.7 (Installed with Anaconda3)

Instructions for installing Tensorflow can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

I installed the basic tensorflow without GPU support using pip.

For me, this command line didn't work - pip install --upgrade tensorflow
but this did: python3 -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
